    You do not create these , you typically get them from

    Warnings
    ---------
    Due to datagram transmission and reception, the `opus`
    library must be installed on your system.

    Also, you need to add the location of the ffmpeg binary
    to the executable path because `ffmpeg` is used for the
    audio playback process.

    Parameters
    ------------
    client: :class:`~discord.Client`
        The client (or its subclasses) that started the connection request.
    channel: :class:`~discord.abc.Connectable`
        The voice channel that is being connected to.
